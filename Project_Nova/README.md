# Project Nova: Data-Driven Credit Access

Project Nova is a machine learning project that creates a new way to measure creditworthiness for Grab drivers.  
Instead of using traditional credit scores, Nova uses *driver performance and reliability data* inside the Grab ecosystem to decide credit access fairly.

---

## What It Does
- Collects driver data (trips, earnings, ratings, cancellations).  
- Engineers features like *earnings stability, **cancellation rate, and **average rating*.  
- Builds a *performance score* for each driver.  
- Uses a machine learning model to predict reliability and generates a *Nova Score (0–1000)*.  

---

## Why It Matters
- Many drivers don’t have formal credit history.  
- Nova provides *fair access to loans and financial products* based on actual work performance.  
- Helps financial partners support drivers who prove reliability on the platform.
